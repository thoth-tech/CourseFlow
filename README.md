# CourseFlow
## Background / Contextâ€¯
CourseFlow is a clear and easy-to-use course planning platform that helps students navigate their course requirements and graduate with confidence.

Each year, several thousand students enrol in Deakin University. Unfortunately, a lot of these students struggle with understanding the requirements they need to fulfil in order to graduate.

What electives do you do, have you met prerequisites or other course rules? What exactly will you learn and benefit from a unit? Universities also have problems with putting out course-relevant information that is easily digestible. Most information in course maps doesn't apply to students that have transferred from other degrees or have an altered path to the original map.
