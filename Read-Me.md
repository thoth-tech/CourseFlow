# CourseFlow - Project

---

## Background / Context

CourseFlow is a clear and easy-to-use course planning platform that helps students navigate their course requirements and graduate with confidence.

Each year, thousands of students enrol in Deakin University, however many struggle to understand their course requirements and what needs to be completed in order to graduate. This can range from the amount of minors or electives, prerequisites, or other important information that all students should know.

CourseFlow aims to help students with this by providing students with a website similar to Melbourne Universities Course Planner by using a clear UI design with emphasis on simplicity and ease-of-use for students of all years, providing them with a clear map of their progress and which steps they can take to achieve their graduation at Deakin University.
