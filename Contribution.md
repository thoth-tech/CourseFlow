## Code of Conduct

As CourseFlow is a project under Thoth Tech, we hold all members and members to high standards of professionalism and communication. By contributing to this project you agree to uphold our [**Code of Conduct**](https://github.com/thoth-tech/CourseFlow/pull/15/commits/583ba19362b996effac9f1481c1dd48e00a5da88).

## First Steps

Contributins made to the repository are done through **Pull Requests (PRs)**, and the general idea for members to do is:

- Look at the CourseFlow [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/eSAkspIF/courseflow) to see available tasks to complete.
- The story points shown are a good indicator for members to gauge how complex a task is and how much time should be invested to complete it within a sprint.
- Install **GitHub Desktop (GD**) as it allows users a streamlined, easy way to create PRs towards the CourseFlow Project's GitHub repository.

## GitHub Desktop

Pull Requests are easily done through GitHub Desktop, which can be installed [here](https://desktop.github.com/). Once GD is installed, the steps you should take are:

1. Log in using your GitHub Account
2. Create a local repository on your device by syncing your branch to GD and creating an empty folder for it. A official document on how to do this can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github/syncing-your-branch-in-github-desktop)
3. Ensure that the branch selected on the CourseFlow GitHub is 'development'.

## Pull Requests

Creating PRs are easy to do using GD. This can be done through the steps:

1. Copy the desired document/file into the local repository folder, this can be done through Visual Studio Code, or directly into the folder.
2. Back on GD, write a description of its functions and why it was created.
3. Push request towards the repository.
